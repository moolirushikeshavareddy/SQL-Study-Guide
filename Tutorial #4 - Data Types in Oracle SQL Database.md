# Study Guide: Tutorial #4 - Data Types in Oracle SQL Database

## I. Introduction
In this tutorial, we'll explore the various data types available in the Oracle database. Understanding these data types is crucial for effective database design and management.

## II. Major Categories of Data Types
Oracle has divided data types into five major categories: 

1. **Number**
2. **Character**
3. **Long**
4. **Date**
5. **Raw**

## III. Detailed Breakdown of Data Types

### 1. Number
- Used for storing numeric values
- Further details to be covered in the next session

### 2. Character
Character data types are subdivided into: 
- **CHAR**
- **VARCHAR2**
- **NCHAR**
- **NVARCHAR2**

### 3. Long

- **CLOB** (Character Large Object)
- **NCLOB** (National Character Large Object)

## IV. Additional Data Type
- **ROWID**: A unique identifier for each row in a table

## V. Key Points to Remember
- Each data type serves a specific purpose in database design
- Choosing the right data type is crucial for data integrity and efficiency
- The next tutorial will cover more details on when and why to use each data type
